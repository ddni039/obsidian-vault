# Wiki Schema

## Domain
AI Agent技術、生態系與應用。涵蓋 AI Agent 框架、模型、工具、平台、比較與趨勢。

## Conventions
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g., `hermes-agent.md`, `claude-code.md`)
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter (see below)
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`
- **Provenance markers:** On pages that synthesize 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source-file.md]`
  at the end of paragraphs whose claims come from a specific source

## Frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: Page Title
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
tags: [from taxonomy below]
sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
confidence: high | medium | low
contested: true
contradictions: [other-page-slug]
---
```

## Tag Taxonomy
- agent: agent framework, orchestration, autonomous AI
- model: LLM model, provider, API
- tool: MCP, tools, integrations
- platform: deployment, hosting, platform
- research: benchmarks, papers, evaluation
- workflow: use cases, automation patterns
- trend: market, ecosystem, news
- meta: comparison, controversy, prediction

## Page Thresholds
- **Create a page** when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Add to existing page** when a source mentions something already covered
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, minor details
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines
- **Archive a page** when fully superseded — move to `_archive/`, remove from index

## Entity Pages
One page per notable entity. Include:
- Overview / what it is
- Key facts and dates
- Relationships to other entities ([[wikilinks]])
- Source references

## Concept Pages
One page per concept or topic. Include:
- Definition / explanation
- Current state of knowledge
- Open questions or debates
- Related concepts ([[wikilinks]])

## Comparison Pages
Side-by-side analyses. Include:
- What is being compared and why
- Dimensions of comparison (table format preferred)
- Verdict or synthesis
- Sources

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Check the dates — newer sources generally supersede older ones
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Mark the contradiction in frontmatter: `contradictions: [page-name]`
4. Flag for user review in the lint report
